# Udacity Project: Portfolio
For the Udacity's nanodegree: Front-End Web Developer.
For this project, I built a portfolio website. I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and I had to  replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website that displays images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.
